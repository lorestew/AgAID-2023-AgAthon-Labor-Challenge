# 2023 Digital AgAthon Labor Challenge Project

Based off of the PyTorch Torchvision object detection finetuning tutorial. Uses a pre-trained Mask R-CNN model that is finetuned to detect apples in orchards. The dataset used for traning "MinneApple: A Benchmark Dataset for Apple Detection and Segmentation"
